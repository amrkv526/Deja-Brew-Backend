The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack web app. Our group chose to create a website which allows to find nearest independent coffee shops based on three chosen locations. 

I worked on the back-end of the site, my contributions being: 
-Creating a database in MySQL Server
-Creating an API in python which calls on the database and returns requested data and uploads entered data, such as new user information
-Setting up mobile authentication using Twilio
